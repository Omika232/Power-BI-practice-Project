House Rent Analysis & Predictive Modeling Project

Transforming raw data into actionable insights! Here’s how I tackled house rent prediction using advanced data analytics and machine learning:

🔍 Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering : Cleaned and preprocessed house rent data, creating new columns (year, month) for enhanced temporal analysis. Ensured data was ready for deep insights and accurate predictions.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged Power BI to uncover key trends like city-wise rent distribution, seasonal patterns, and correlations between property features and rent. Developed interactive dashboards that bring data stories to life.

🧠 Predictive Modeling: Built and fine-tuned multiple regression models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression. Achieved high accuracy in predicting rent prices, empowering data-driven decisions.

💡Business Impact: Delivered insights that optimize pricing strategies and forecast rental trends. The final model offers reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for the real estate market.

🚀  Power BI Dashboard for HR Analysis 📊

I'm excited to share my latest project, where I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard focused on employee attrition analysis. This dashboard leverages key metrics such as KPIs, age group distribution, gender, salary slabs, attrition rates, and job roles to provide deep insights into employee turnover within an organization.

Key Highlights:
📈 KPIs : Tracking overall performance and attrition trends.
🎂 Age Group Analysis : Identifying trends across different age brackets.
👩‍💼 Gender Analysis : Understanding gender-based attrition patterns.
💼 Salary Slabs : Examining attrition rates across various salary levels.
🏢 Job Role : Analyzing attrition by specific job roles.

This project showcases the power of data visualization in identifying crucial HR trends and driving informed decision-making.
