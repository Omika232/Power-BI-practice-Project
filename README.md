House Rent Analysis & Predictive Modeling Project

Transforming raw data into actionable insights! Here’s how I tackled house rent prediction using advanced data analytics and machine learning:

🔍 Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering : Cleaned and preprocessed house rent data, creating new columns (year, month) for enhanced temporal analysis. Ensured data was ready for deep insights and accurate predictions.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged Power BI to uncover key trends like city-wise rent distribution, seasonal patterns, and correlations between property features and rent. Developed interactive dashboards that bring data stories to life.

🧠 Predictive Modeling: Built and fine-tuned multiple regression models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression. Achieved high accuracy in predicting rent prices, empowering data-driven decisions.

💡Business Impact: Delivered insights that optimize pricing strategies and forecast rental trends. The final model offers reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for the real estate market.
